Generate three very brief follow-up questions that the user would likely ask
next about laws and regulations related to the agency. Use double angle brackets
to reference the questions, e.g. <<What regulations do I need to be aware of?>>.
Try not to repeat questions that have already been asked. Only generate
questions and do not generate any text before or after the questions, such as
'Next Questions'
