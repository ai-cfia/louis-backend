# inspection.gc.ca crawler

## planned functionality

* crawl extract content (main tag) from main website and store in postgres
* separate content into chunks
* get embeddings from chunks
* index documents using embeddings and vectorstore
* build search API (converting queries to embedding and searching vectorstore)
* plugin search functionality in conversational agent

stretch

* build indexing-on-request API (can accept, queue and process external links)

## running the crawlers

We use the crawlers in a little bit of a non-standard way.

Instead of hitting a website, we pick up the URL from disk

As a second step, we pick up rows from the database

As a third step, we pick up rows from the database to pass to the embedding API

goldie crawler: HTML from disk dump in Cache/:

```
scrapy crawl goldie --logfile goldie.log
```

hawn crawler: crawl table to chunk and token:

```
scrapy crawl hawn --logfile hawn.log
```


## database setup

We've added the devcontainer postgres feature. Config files are in

```
/home/vscode/.asdf/installs/postgres/15.3/data/*.conf
```

In the devcontainer you can start the database:

```
pg_ctl start
```

```
psql -U postgres
CREATE USER vscode;
ALTER USER vscode WITH SUPERUSER;
```

and then

```
createdb -E utf-8 inspection.canada.ca
```

and then

```
psql -d inspection.canada.ca
```

## postgresql extensions

```
pip install pgxnclient
pgxn install vector
```

see extensions available: https://pgxn.org/

## database client
